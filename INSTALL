Building from a release tarball
-------------------------------

Prerequisites: Lua 5.1 and the following libraries:

   luabitop >= 1.0.0 (http://bitop.luajit.org/)
   lrexlib >= 2.5.0 (http://luaforge.net/projects/lrexlib)
   lcurses >= 4 (http://luaforge.net/projects/lcurses)
   luaposix >= 5.1.11 (http://luaforge.net/projects/luaposix)

1) Run configure:

        ./configure

2) Compile the sources:

        make

3) To install Zile, run

        make install

   By default, Zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zile


Building from the repository
----------------------------

Extra prerequisites: automake >= 1.9, autoconf >= 2.61, recent gnulib
(at time of reading!), help2man.

Check out Zile and bootstrap the build system:

        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git --branch lua
        ./autogen.sh

Then follow the instructions for building from a release tarball.


Automated releases
------------------

To make a release automatically, you need ncftp, and woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger
