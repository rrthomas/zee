INTRODUCTION
============

Zee is a lightweight editor. Zee is aimed at small footprint systems
and quick editing sessions (it starts up and shuts down instantly).
Zee's home page is at:

  > <https://github.com/rrthomas/zee>

Zee is written in Lua 5.2 using POSIX APIs, and requires these
additional modules:

 * Lua stdlib <https://github.com/rrthomas/lua-stdlib>
 * lrexlib <http://rrthomas.github.com/lrexlib/>
   (the rex_gnu module must be built)
 * luaposix <https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix>
   (the curses module must be built)
 * alien <http://mascarenhas.github.com/alien/>

For the exact versions required, see `src/loadlibs.lua.in`.


INSTALLING
==========

The simplest way to install the latest release of Zee is to use
[Luarocks][]

  [Luarocks]: http://luarocks.org/

Run:

    luarocks install zee

Development sources are available from the web page. When you are
building Zee from a git checkout, you first need to run the
`bootstrap` script to generate various files that are shipped in
release tarballs, but not checked in to git.


REPORTING BUGS
==============

If Zee doesn't work for you, before you report the problem, please try
upgrading to the latest released version first, to see whether your
issue has been fixed already. If you can, please also check whether
the latest development sources still exhibit the problem.

Please file bug reports in the issue tracker at the home page (see
above).

If you're not an experienced bug reporter, please read this before
reporting a bug:

  > <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>

Zee has a suite of tests in the source distribution, which you can run
with:

    make check

If, when you report a bug, you can create a similar test that
demonstrates it, the maintainers will be most grateful, and it will
prevent them from accidentally reintroducing the bug in a subsequent
release.
